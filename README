Written by Patrick Jenkins on 8/7/2009 with the goal to create a better
way to distribute MBTA bus schedules.

Source code available at http://github.com/patjenk/Bus-T-Now/tree/master

Future ideas:
* Done! Product JSON and XML files
* REST API
* Web app to display the next time a bus is stopping near you
* IPhone app to display the next time a bus is stopping near you
