Written by Patrick Jenkins on 8/7/2009. This tool reads in a list of bus route
names from a file named 'bus_routes.txt' which needs to be in the current
directory. You can build this file by running the tool in 
tools/scrapers/routers/. When you run the script in this directory two files 
will be created containing the bus schedules for the MBTA. The files that are
produced are named routes.xml and routes.json.

This tool uses simplejson for JSON serialization and xml.marshal.generic for
XML serialization.
